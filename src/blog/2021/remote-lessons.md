To wrap up this series on [remote work](/tags/remote/), I'm going to focus on the things that improve a remote worker's life. In this article, I'll share what has worked for me on an individual level and, in a later post, tackle what can be done and offered at the company/team level.

First, a reality check about what working remotely has looked like for me. Pre-COVID, your social media streams may have been filled with images of folks with their laptops at airports, on beaches, in coffeeshops, in Airstream trailers. Remote work was seen as a means into a ✨ digital nomad ✨ lifestyle.

Since March 2020, the imagery used to describe remote work has changed **a lot**. The serenity and, let's admit it, aspirational nature has been replaced mostly by chaos: partners working side-by-side on the couch, a kitchen table that is an office and a classroom, the [WFH mullet](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9-l99cpxyu/).

Neither of these pictures represent my experience as a remote worker.
