For the last five years, the community at Dev.to has used International Women's Day as an impetus to share the stories of women who code. Since I've been active there as a reader and commenter (in addition to cross-posting my blog there), I decided to participate.

Read [my post](https://dev.to/angeliquejw/nevertheless-angelique-coded-186j) for some sweet '80s and '90s tech nostalgia and [enjoy the posts by other members of the Dev.to community](https://dev.to/shecoded).
