If you started working from home in spring 2020, I would like to tell you with my full heart and full voice that your experience as a remote worker has been so very different than [my experiences as a remote worker for the last decade-plus](/blog/2021/my-remote-journey).

This is important because, barely after the dust of the transition had settled, folks were fretting and opining about worker productivity in articles, in blogs, on Twitter. Making these questions and concerns about the viability of remote work is, to me, pretty deceptive framing. In reality, what folks were asking is, "How productive can we expect workers to be in a pandemic or other national/global crisis?"

So, let's break it down: how is working through a pandemic different than working remotely?

## Overnight transition

Because this shift to remote work was in response to a health crisis, it was done with a speed that remains shocking:

> Within just three weeks (mid-March to early April), the percentage of Americans working from home doubled from 31% to 62% as offices and schools shuttered to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

<cite>&mdash;Ellyn Maese and Lydia Saad, [Gallup Panel Data (April 2020)](https://news.gallup.com/poll/339824/pandemic-affected-work-life.aspx)</cite>

No question, this is how things _needed_ to happen, but that speed also came at a cost.

In comparison, when Fractured Atlas was transitioning from a hybrid organization to a fully virtual one, we spent 6-8 months planning the transition&mdash;and that was with a significant number of employees already working remotely.

The speed of the current transition left many scrambling.

Employers had to figure out:

- how to equip workers at home
- ways to share information securely and asynchronously
- how and where to hire folks going forward

Teams were required to do all the same work, but adapt to doing it remotely:

- communicating and collaborating
- supporting each other
- maintaining team culture

Individuals needed to:

- carve out "office" space in their homes, often a shared resource with the other adults they share the space with and/or kids who also suddenly needed remote classrooms
- attempt to maintain work-life balance when the two were suddenly right on top of each other

- quick transition, setup and space at home, practices at work, boundaries

## Unprecedented levels of instability

- financial instability
- a global health crisis

## All Zoom, all the time

- lack of social outlets, no vacations

## Extra credit: You're a parent

- kids

None of the things listed above should be shocking, but when they go unsaid/assumed...

What can you do

- embrace async
- role model healthy boundaries, talk about what works for you
- "pandemic tax" to your productivity estimates
