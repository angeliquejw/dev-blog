# No thanks to "Business as usual"
## Teams and companies that made an effort to treat their employees humanely on Jan 6, 2021

<div class="content-container">

In the evening of January 6, 2021, I sent out [a tweet](https://twitter.com/messypixels/status/1346992491577401344){:target=_blank} asking which companies or managers had acknowledged the day's events. This list compiles the info from the public and private responses I received from that tweet.

[This blog post](/blog/2021/leading-with-humanity/) provides some additional context and details for this data. But this is the crucial bit:

> This is not meant to be a list of Good Companies™️. This list is not definitive proof that these companies are good places to work now or in the future.

> So, what is this then? **This is, specifically, a list of companies where an employee felt treated humanely enough on January 6th to reach out to me and let me know about it.**

> To me, that is a data point. It is interesting and worthwhile, but it also shouldn’t be overstated. It’s one employee’s experience at a very specific time. In some (most?) cases, the company leadership may not have even made any statement, but an individual’s manager or team lead did.

## 💡 A note
I did hear from employees of FB and GOOG about how their teams handled things on this day. I've made the personal decision to **not** include them in the list above because, not only do they not need my assistance with recruitment, but also their products played a very serious role in the day's events. I'm not in the business of awarding out gold stars and doubly so in those cases. 🤷🏻‍♀️
