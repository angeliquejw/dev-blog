💡 _This section used to be a GoodReads widget, but I stopped using that service in 2021. I'm now using [The StoryGraph](https://thestorygraph.com/) to log reading, but they don't have widgets or an API, so this is an artisinally hand-updated version of my [reading log](https://app.thestorygraph.com/currently-reading/angeliquejw)._
